Barrier now uses SHA256 fingerprints for establishing security of encrypted SSL connections.
After upgrading client to new version the existing server fingerprint will need to be approved again.
Client and server will show both SHA1 and SHA256 server fingerprints to allow interoperability
with older versions of Barrier.
