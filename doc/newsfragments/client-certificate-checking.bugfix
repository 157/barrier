SECURITY ISSUE

Barrier now supports client identity verification (fixes CVE-2021-42072, CVE-2021-42073).

To support seamless upgrades from older versions of Barrier this is currently disabled by default.
The feature can be enabled in the settings dialog. If enabled, older clients of Barrier will be
rejected.
